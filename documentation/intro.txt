Yannick asked me to say a few words about docker, specifically about the nice things it will bring us

I was given a 15 mins timeframe to do this talk, so I dont have space for interruptions and questions, sorry about that



INTRO

1. OS NOT packaged which makes it leightweight
2. CONTROLLED AND ISOLATED - process controlled in sense of CPU and MEM usage and living in isolated namespace 


PACKAGING

so what does this give us

Docker redefines how we package and ship our software to our runtime environments


AUTOMATION

We are not only responsible for deployments we also support development teams with SDLC tooling CI/CD all about automation

Docker alone not enough to do the job -> PIPELINE IS FILLING IN THE MISSING PART TO REACH FULL AUTOMATION

GROOVY LARGE COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION (ATLASSIEN JIRA) THROUGH SHARED LIBRARIES

GROOVY BECAUSE OF OO NA


DEVELOPMENT PROCESS

all about visibility of CODE and FUNCTIONALITY

PROJECT backed up by only one test environment

review visibility on BRANCH LEVEL impossible till now (CROSS FUNCTIONAL TEAM)

DOCKER ISOLATION AND LEIGHTWEIGHTNESS ENABLES TO US TO PROVIDE EVERY BRANCH A FULLY INTEGRATED TEST ENVIRONMENT


FUTURE

DEPLOYMENTS DONE THROUGH JIRA TICKETS
DEPLOYMENT TICKET TRIGGERS WORKFLOW TO RUN ON STATE CHANGE.
